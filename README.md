# Hi there, I'm Erdem BELER! 👋

### Full-Stack & Mobile Developer | IOS Specialist | SaaS Founder

I don’t just write code; I build end-to-end digital products and businesses. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between high-performance native mobile apps and scalable SaaS ecosystems.

- **Frontend & Mobile:** Deep experience in Swift and React Native, focusing on minimalist UI/UX.
- **Backend & Cloud:** Experience with Firebase and PostgreSQL, ensuring scalable and secure data management.
- **Hardware & DevOps:** Proficient in Shell scripting and optimizing Linux-based systems (Raspberry/Orange Pi) for industrial use cases.
- **Full Lifecycle:** Experienced in taking projects from local development to global sales, including SEO and Google Ads strategy.

I am a developer who loves building end-to-end solutions, from low-level hardware scripts to high-level mobile architectures. My focus lies in creating seamless user experiences with a minimalist touch and solving complex problems with AI and automation.
